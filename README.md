# Chris Beard's Portfolio

## Purpose
This assignment was to create a porfolio of my work. The first three images are links to projects I have created and the last two are placeholders until I can create more web applications. There is a link to my resume and how to contact me for future employers. 

## Description
The website will be mobile responsive and the work boxes will switch to a column when the screen size changes. The section headers will also disappear when on a mobile device. This website is to help me showcase the projects I have created and interest potential employers. 

## Usage
Upload the HTML index file and assets folder. The assets folder contains the links and images for the website.
