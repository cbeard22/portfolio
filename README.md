# Chris Beard's Portfolio

## Description
This is my porfolio of the web applications that I have worked on with a team and by myself. The first three images are links to projects I have created and the last two are placeholders until I can create more web applications. There is a link to my resume for future employers and other ways to contact me as well.
The website will be desktop and mobile device friendly too.
