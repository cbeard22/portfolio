# Chris Beard's Portfolio

#Purpose
This assignment was to create a porfolio of your work. We are only in week 2 so I do not have any work to attach. I linked Google to the work and I used random images as placeholders until i develop more work to showcase. 


#Description
The website will be mobile responsive and the work boxes will swith to a column when the screen size changes. The section headers will also disappear when on a mobile device. This website is to help me showcase the projects I have created and interest potential employers.
